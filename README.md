# Personal-Keylogger

1. This keylogger uses the pynput library to log all keyboard strokes aswell as eash mouse press. All inputs are recorded to a log file with, paired with date and time of each action.

2. Pushover, a notification app for Iphone and Android is implemented into this, when the first action is taken after the keylogger is ran, an alert notification is sent to a device (USER_KEY & API_KEY need to be set by user in config file).

3. dxcam is utilised to take screenshots at every mouse press, these screenshots are saved and can be viewed.

4. ESC is used as the key to neutralise the keylogger, however this can be changed to any key / combination.

5. This is for personal use, and should not be used in any malicous capacity.
